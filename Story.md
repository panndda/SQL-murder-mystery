The detective has provided with some information about the missing file, the goal at this stage is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from  the police departmentâ€™s database.
To do this, a couple of queries were written to query the database in order to get the desired data from the crime_scene_report table which houses data about crimes.

```
Select * 
From crime_scene_report
Where type = 'murder' and date = 20180115 and city = 'SQL City';
```
